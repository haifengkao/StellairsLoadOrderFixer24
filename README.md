# StellairsLoadOrderFixer24
Sort Stellaris mods in *reverse* alphabetical order because 2.4's mod load order is different from 2.3.3

Force load all incompatible mods (you can disable them manually in the launcher)

## How to use
Download [load_order_stellaris24.exe](https://github.com/haifengkao/StellairsLoadOrderFixer24/releases/download/1.1/load_order_stellaris24.exe)

Then double click it

If you see "done", the load order has been succesfully sorted
If you see “mod_registry” not found, please run the exe inside local mod folder
