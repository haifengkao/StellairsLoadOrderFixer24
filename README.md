# StellairsLoadOrderFixer24
Sort Stellaris mods in *reverse* alphabetical order because 2.4's mod load order is different from 2.3.3
The mods at the bottom will override the mods on the top.

Will sort all mods, but only enable mods already enabled.

The UI Overhaul mods and Dark UI mods will be put at the bottom.
All patches will be put after main mods.

Support Stellaris 2.5.*

## How to use
Download [load_order_stellaris24.exe](https://github.com/haifengkao/StellairsLoadOrderFixer24/releases/download/1.3/load_order_stellaris24.exe)

Then double click it

If you see "done", the load order has been succesfully sorted

If you see “mod_registry” not found, please run the exe inside local mod folder
